This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from the lecture. For the convenience to observe the results, Jupyter Notebook is used for coding.

All the solutions are completed by `python` except for Exercise 4, which is completed by `R`. This is because Exercise 4 requires to use the R library `glmnet`. Although there are several versions `glmnet` packages in `python`, it's a tricky
thing to install and build them on my Windows operation system. However, one could also use `sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet` to do the job as `glmnet` does. But the default values in those two languages have to be checked carefully in advance.
